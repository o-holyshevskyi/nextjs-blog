# What is Functional Programming?
<a name="what-is-functional-programming"></a>

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state or mutable data. 
It emphasizes the use of pure functions, immutability, and higher-order functions to structure and solve problems. 
In functional programming, programs are constructed by composing functions, which promotes code that is more predictable, maintainable, and easier to reason about.

### Core principles of functional programming
<a name="core-principles-of-functional-programming"></a>

Here are explanations of the core principles of functional programming:

1. **Immutability**:
- Immutability refers to the concept that data, once created, cannot be modified. Instead of changing existing data, you create new data structures.
- In functional programming, immutability ensures that functions do not have side effects, making it easier to reason about and debug code.
- Immutable data is thread-safe, which is particularly important in concurrent or parallel programming.
2. **Pure Functions**:
- Pure functions are functions that, given the same input, always produce the same output without modifying any external state or variables.
- They have no side effects, meaning they don't change any data outside the function's scope.
- Pure functions are predictable and testable, making debugging and testing easier.
3. **Higher-Order Functions**:
- Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as results.
- They enable abstraction and code reuse. Common examples of higher-order functions include **map**, **filter**, and **reduce**, which work with arrays and allow you to apply a given function to each element.
- Callback functions and closures are often used with higher-order functions to encapsulate behavior.

These core principles of functional programming collectively aim to make code more reliable, maintainable, and easier to understand. 
By embracing immutability, pure functions, and higher-order functions, functional programming encourages a declarative and concise coding style that is well-suited for tasks like automation testing.
